# Obesity---final-project
For my final project in the Programming and Database course, I selected the obesity level dataset, which 
is quite renowned. The dataset includes data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the 
countries of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition.
The dataset consists of 17 attributes and 2111 records, each labeled with the class variable "NObesity" 
(Obesity Level), allowing for the classification of data using feature values. While the dataset is generally 
clean, as part of the project, I intentionally introduced some random deletions or value changes to create 
outliers or simulate bad data.
This dataset is well-suited for both classification and clustering tasks in the modeling phase. So, by using 
the features and classifying modeling, we can estimate the obesity levels. Additionally, various graphs can 
be used to visually represent the relationships between features
