# Estimation of obesity levels based on eating habits and physical conditions
It is my first project in the Data Science field. It was also my first coding experience with Python. Before it, I had many projects in MATLAB and most of them were related to my previous study field in Electrical Engineering. 

This project was part of the Programming and Databases course. I selected the obesity level dataset, which is quite renowned. The dataset includes data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The dataset consists of 17 attributes and 2111 records, each labeled with the class variable "NObesity" (Obesity Level), allowing the classification of data using feature values.

While the dataset is generally clean, as part of the project, I intentionally introduced some random deletions or value changes to create outliers or simulate bad data. This dataset is well-suited to both classification and clustering tasks in the modeling phase. So, by using these features and classified models, we can estimate obesity levels. Additionally, various graphs can be used to visually represent the relationship between these features. To present the results, I used the Streamlit library. You can customize the presentation and results. 

I need to mention that because of the purpose of the course, the main focus of the project was on coding, not the data analysis part.
